# Instrument-Sound-Processing
Experimentation and Ideation regarding how sounds made by musical instruments can be processed.

## Aim
- Create a processing engine using a simple audio recoriding device / WAV file

_Note: Currently generate WAV files using the following tools_
```
Instrument: GRG131DX Ibanez Electric guitar
Audio Device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Family 17h (Models 10h-1fh) HD Audio Controller
Recording Software: Audacity
```
The ideas and experiments explored will extend to other tools as well.

## Features Explored / Exploring
- De-noising
- Amplifier + Sound Effects (Distortion, Fuzz etc.) Post-processing
- Generation of audio by model trained on real amplifiers / sound effects.
