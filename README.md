# Instrument-Sound-Processing
Experimentation and Ideation regarding how sounds made by musical instruments can be processed.

## Denoising
An analysis on algorithms for de-noising an audio file
- [Use STFT and remove frequencies under an amplitude threshold to De-noise the WAV file.](https://github.com/yde773786/Instrument-Sound-Processing/blob/main/Denoising/stft_denoising.ipynb)

## Genre Identification
Analysis, comparison, and rationale of approaches towards identifying the genre of an audio recording of a song
- [Use 2D CNNs on Spectograms of audio files to identify music genres](https://github.com/yde773786/Instrument-Sound-Processing/blob/main/Genre%20Classification/mel_spec_classifier.ipynb)
- [Use 1D CNN on audio file to identify music genres](https://github.com/yde773786/Instrument-Sound-Processing/blob/main/Genre%20Classification/wav_classifier.ipynb)
- [Use domain knowledge to extract features of a recording that affect genre and pass through a fully-connected layer.](https://github.com/yde773786/Instrument-Sound-Processing/blob/main/Genre%20Classification/feature_extraction_classifier.ipynb)
